              MyReads is an app that enhances book management and discovery, allowing you to search for any book via the
              Google Books API. Organize your reading list into categories like to-read, currently reading, and read,
              and set annual goals. Progress indicators show how much you’ve read of each book and how close you are to
              reaching your annual goal, motivating you to read more. With Firebase, MyReads ensures your list and
              progress are synchronized across devices, so you always have access to them.

            When a user selects a book, the app provides a detailed view with additional information from the Google

              In MVVM architecture, the clear separation between user interface, presentation logic, and business logic
              is essential. The ViewModel serves as the intermediary between the View and the Repository, retrieving
              data from the Repository, which manages data access. The ViewModel then transforms this data for
              presentation in the View. This organization allows the View to focus on display, while the ViewModel
              handles data access and processing logic, enhancing the application’s scalability and maintainability.

                Managing data access, the Repository provides the ViewModel with necessary methods to retrieve the

                Repository encapsulates data access logic. This arrangement lets the ViewModel concentrate on
                presentation logic, while the Repository takes care of data management, improving code modularity and

                Direct interaction with Firestore to retrieve user information is handled by the DataSource. This
                component performs the necessary operations to access data from Firestore, abstracting the complexity of
                read and write operations. The Repository uses the DataSource’s methods to obtain data, which the
                ViewModel then processes and presents. This abstraction simplifies data management by keeping the
                details of database access separate from presentation logic.

            Developing this app has been an incredibly enriching experience, though I must admit it had an unexpected
            effect: I now have more books on my reading list than before! The irony of creating a tool to organize
            reading and motivate users to read more has led to an avalanche of new titles for me. So, while the process
            has been exciting, I’m ready to dive back into my books right away! Don’t worry, though—I’ll be sneaking in
            a few on SwiftUI to keep things balanced.

                I recognize that the app still has plenty of room for improvement and requires refinements in functions,
                design, and code structure. Next, I will focus on studying and implementing tests to enhance the app’s
                robustness and reliability. The MyReads code is available on GitHub, and I’m open to suggestions and
                constructive feedback that can help me refine the app and continue developing my skills. I’m excited to
                take on new challenges and explore opportunities for collaborating on innovative projects. If you have
                ideas or are looking for someone for your next project, feel free to get in touch.
